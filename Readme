The project name is Angry Bird
To run our game first you have to download all the files and set up in the desktop then setup the gradle then
you can run our game.

So in the assets we have all the images regarding all the screens and buttons and all. All are downloaded from
online resouces some from google, some from twitter some from facebook mostly google.

For now we have 4 screens namely, Level1Screen, MainMenu, MainScreen , PauseMenuScreen

when we run the code the Main class or Main screen runs and automaitcally switch us to the MainMenu Screen which
is our start screen then we click on the start the we switch to the MainScreen there for now we have 3 levels and
for now all the 3 levels points to the same level late we will made it correct.

And in that level we have the pause screen button by clicking on that we can switch to pause menu screen and by
clicking on the resume button we can go back to the level1 screen

For now this is it
Hope it was good..

the functioning is explained in the video and i'll show you at the demo..
